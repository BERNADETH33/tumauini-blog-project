            </h2>
            <p class="mb-6">
                Located right in the heart of the Town Plaza of Tumauini, this Spanish-era church immediately stands out. Most colonial churches in the Philippines used stone and stucco, but the Tumauini Church embraced **baked red bricks** for its entire construction, making it one of the most distinctive religious structures in the country. It stands as a lasting symbol of colonial heritage, artistry, and the deep faith of the region.

            </h2>
            <p class="mb-4">The story of the Tumauini Church is one of resilience and careful craftsmanship:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 ml-4">
                <li>**1707:** The original structure was built from light materials by the Dominican friar **Francisco N√∫√±ez**.</li>
                <li>**1783-1805:** The current, magnificent brick church was commissioned by **Fr. Domingo Forto** and painstakingly completed over two decades. Forto hired artisans from Pampanga to execute the intricate brickwork.</li>
                <li>**20th Century:** The church sustained damage during **World War II** but was later restored with great care to preserve its original details.</li>
                <li>**Recognition:** Its historical and architectural importance has been formally recognized, earning it the designation of a **National Historical Landmark (1989)** and, more significantly, a **National Cultural Treasure** by the National Museum of the Philippines.</li>

                Architectural Highlights ‚ú®
            </h2>
            <p class="mb-6">The Tumauini Church is a prime example of **Baroque architecture** adapted with local materials. Its defining features are what make it a must-see:</p>

            <div class="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-8">
                <!-- Highlight 1: All-Brick Design -->
                <div class="p-4 bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg hover:shadow-xl transition duration-300">
                    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2 text-brick-red">All-Brick Design</h3>
                    <p>The sheer volume of exposed red bricks is mesmerizing. This isn't just a structural element; it's the defining aesthetic. The vibrant, deep red hue often seems to change color depending on the light, appearing fiery at sunset.</p>
                </div>

                <!-- Highlight 2: Detailed Ornamentation -->
                <div class="p-4 bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg hover:shadow-xl transition duration-300">
                    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2 text-brick-red">Detailed Ornamentation</h3>
                    <p>Look closely at the fa√ßade! It‚Äôs a tapestry of intricate brick carvings. You‚Äôll find decorative elements like **flowers, cherubs, and religious patterns** meticulously molded and placed by the Pampanga artisans. This detail elevates the Tumauini Church from a simple building to a work of art.</p>
                </div>

                <!-- Highlight 3: The Cylindrical Bell Tower -->
                <div class="md:col-span-2 p-4 bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg hover:shadow-xl transition duration-300">
                    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2 text-brick-red">The Cylindrical Bell Tower</h3>
                    <p class="mb-4">
                        This is perhaps the church‚Äôs most famous feature. It is the **only known circular belfry** from the Spanish colonial era in the entire country. Its tiered, wedding-cake shape creates a stark and beautiful contrast to the rectangular lines of the church proper. Its worn texture only adds to its historical charm.
